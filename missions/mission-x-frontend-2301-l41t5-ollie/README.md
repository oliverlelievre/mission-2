- folder 'public'
    - folder images (All images are to be stored in here)
- folder 'src'
    - folder 'Components' (All re-usable components)
    - folder 'Styling' (All CSS modules required)
    - folder 'Pages' (All Pages which import re-usable components)

Ideally No new folders are to be created unless discussed first to avoid conflicts/confusion.

# Name Conventions:
- thisIsSnakeCase / ThisIsCamelCase

- All Components/Pages are to named with CamelCase
    - When naming Components please reference which page your component relates to.
        - ie: HomePageNavBar.js - HomePageFooter.js - StudentProfileNavBar.js

- All CSS styling className are to named with CamelCase 
    - When naming classNames please reference which page/component your module relates to.
        - ie: HomePageNavBar.module.css - HomePageFooter.module.css - StudentProfileNavBar.module.css
- All Images are to be re-named with snakeCase
    - ie: student01.jpg - homeLogo.png - studentProfileIcon.png
